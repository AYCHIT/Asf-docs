Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
################################

This is a non-exhaustive list of frequently (or infrequently) asked questions
about the `Python Software Foundation`_ that I have been asked. 

What is the Python Software Foundation ?
========================================

This one is easy, given it's answered on the home page:

    The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation 
    that holds the intellectual property rights behind the Python programming 
    language. We manage the open source licensing for Python version 2.1 and 
    later and own and protect the trademarks associated with Python. We also 
    run the North American PyCon conference annually, support other Python 
    conferences around the world, and fund Python related development with 
    our grants program and by funding special projects.

    -- See `Python Software Foundation`_

Now, that's fine and all - but the `Mission Statement`_ is actually a lot more
interesting. Yeah, it's fine that we're a non-profit, and we hold some IP, but
what's the **mission** of the organization other than that?

Once again, quoting:

    The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and 
    advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the 
    growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

    -- See `Mission Statement`_

What is the relationship between PyCon US and the PSF?
======================================================

The PSF funds, backs and takes on the risk for PyCon US (or PyCon North America
if you will, since it will be in Montreal Canada in 2014/2015). This means that
it is the one conference the PSF has an officer assigned to, controls the
budget of and provides oversight of.

Has the PSF donated to causes outside of Python? To other languages ?
=====================================================================

Does the PSF have any paid staff ?
==================================

How much money per year does it take to run the PSF ?
=====================================================

Has anyone donated to the foundation through a will ?
=====================================================

Are all your funds held in US dollars? 
======================================

Does Guido van Rossum have any connection with the foundation?
==============================================================

Are there any metrics used to determine the success of the foundation?
======================================================================

How far out has Python spread in the universe?
==============================================

**(has NASA or another space agency used python in equipment out beyond Earth?)**

While we like to think that it's pretty far out that NASA are a big fan of Python, 
using it at JPL for example to test many aspects of the Mars Space Lab during its 
design and construction. NASA Goddard are another big user, writing of the Twisted 
project's logo "we would be proud to display it (as we do the Python and wxPython 
logos)". 

As far as we know, though, nobody is yet running a Python interpreter outside the 
Earth's atmosphere. We have a feeling it's only a matter of time.

Given quantum entanglement, though, who knows what's really going on out there?
