Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
################################

This is a non-exhaustive list of frequently (or infrequently) asked questions
about the `Python Software Foundation`_ that I have been asked. 

What is the Python Software Foundation ?
========================================

This one is easy, given it's answered on the home page:

    The Python Software Foundation (PSF) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation 
    that holds the intellectual property rights behind the Python programming 
    language. We manage the open source licensing for Python version 2.1 and 
    later and own and protect the trademarks associated with Python. We also 
    run the North American PyCon conference annually, support other Python 
    conferences around the world, and fund Python related development with 
    our grants program and by funding special projects.

    -- See `Python Software Foundation`_

Now, that's fine and all - but the `Mission Statement`_ is actually a lot more
interesting. Yeah, it's fine that we're a non-profit, and we hold some IP, but
what's the **mission** of the organization other than that?

Once again, quoting:

    The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and 
    advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the 
    growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.
