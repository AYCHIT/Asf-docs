Python Software Foundation Supplements!
===========================================================

These documents are notes and information collected by `Jesse Noller`_. These
documents do not replace the existing `Python Software Foundation`_
documentation or notes. These are meant as a staging ground for notes,
frequently (or infrequently) asked questions which can then be rolled into the
main `Python Software Foundation`_ documention. In no way are these documents
comprehensive. Contact `Jesse Noller`_ (`via email`_) if you have additions or
modifications, or submit a pull request on the `github`_ repository!
